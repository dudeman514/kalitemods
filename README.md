*README.md
These are the files that turn kalite into KAlite plus TowTruck.
They replace the files of the same name in the standard KAlite installation.

Also...for KALiteCheckerServer.py
    An independent server currently monitors KALite.  
    If you modify KALite's user interface, you may need to modify the script called loginToKALITE.py   For example, when we installed towtruck we had to the Twill (programmatic browser) object to the Form #2 instead of Form #1, because TowTruck introduced a form of its own.
